[Specification](https://www.openresponses.org/specification/2026-04-24) · [Reference](https://www.openresponses.org/reference/2026-04-24) · [OpenAPI JSON](https://www.openresponses.org/openapi/2026-04-24/openapi.json)

- Added WebSocket transport for `/v1/responses`. Clients start turns with `response.create`, and servers reuse the same semantic streaming events as HTTP streaming.
- Defined sequential WebSocket turns, `previous_response_id` continuation, connection-local state for `store=false`, recovery after disconnects, the 60-minute connection limit, and structured error events.
- Added `POST /v1/responses/compact` and its request and response schemas, including the rules for continuing over WebSockets after compaction.
- Added the optional assistant-message `phase` field with `commentary` and `final_answer` values.
- Made `logprobs` optional in output-text objects and streaming events.
- Corrected the `createResponse` operation ID and completed the `ResponseResource` example.
